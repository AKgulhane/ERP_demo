# ERP System Architecture

## Overview
The ERP system is designed using a modular architecture to handle various business processes efficiently. Each module is self-contained and interacts with other modules through well-defined interfaces.

## Modules
The system is composed of several core modules:
- **Finance and Accounting**
- **Human Resources**
- **Supply Chain Management**
- **Warehouse Management**
- **Material Management**
- **Customer Relationship Management**
- **Production Planning**
- **Sales and Distribution**
- **Project Management**
- **Business Intelligence**
- **Asset Management**
- **E-commerce**

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Ruby on Rails
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Search**: Elasticsearch
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes

## Data Flow
1. **User Interaction**: Users interact with the system through a web interface built with React.js.
2. **API Requests**: The frontend communicates with the backend using RESTful APIs.
3. **Business Logic**: The backend, built with Ruby on Rails, processes the requests, applies business logic, and interacts with the database.
4. **Database**: PostgreSQL stores all persistent data. Redis is used for caching frequently accessed data.
5. **Search**: Elasticsearch provides advanced search capabilities across various modules.
6. **Notifications**: Email notifications are handled via SMTP using SendGrid.

## Security
- **Authentication**: Devise for user authentication.
- **Authorization**: Pundit for role-based access control.
- **Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted using Rails' built-in encryption mechanisms.
- **SSL/TLS**: All communications are secured using SSL/TLS.
